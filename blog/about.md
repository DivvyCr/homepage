Heya!

I'm an aspiring software engineer currently studying Computer Science at the University of
Warwick. Evidently, I'm currently in the UK, and have been here for over 7 years, but I grew up in
Estonia. Below, I provide just two of my character features that are special, which should serve as
an indication for my overall character, at least in my mind.

<br>

Curiously, I passionately value **aesthetics** &mdash; in any task, project, or environment that I
have control over, I strive to make it look just as well as it functions. Specifically, my tastes
lean towards minimalism with a preference for pastel colours, which is evident in my design
projects, my custom Emacs theme, and this website.

Further, I value the appearance of writing (LaTeX) and of code, which is largely defined by its
layout or structure. Hence, I have always prioritised figuring out and conforming with coding (and
academic) standards, especially because it also serves a functional purpose of simplifying traversal
and readability.

<br>

In terms of career endeavours, I'm not looking to build an empire or conversely toil away in a
single well-paying position. At least currently, I really want to explore a large **variety of
software fields**, from tech giants (eg. Google, Apple), to visual effects (eg. Weta), to logistics
systems (eg. transportation, airports), etc. There is something appealing in getting to know the
processes behind a lot of companies at the forefront of some technology.

I guess it's somewhat naive to think that I'll be able to cover that many bases, since each one will
take years just to learn the working environment, or at least that's what I imagine... In any case,
any dream &ndash; however unrealistic &ndash; will serve as the driving force for my ambitions,
which will surely result in fulfillment?
